Build a Video Compilation Page
Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should have a main element as the only child of the body element.
You should have an h1 element with the topic of your page.
You should have a paragraph introducing the topic of your page below your h1 element.
You should have three section elements below your first paragraph.
Each section should contain an h2 element, a paragraph, and an iframe element, in this order.
The three iframe elements should have a src attribute set to a valid video.
Each iframe element should also have a title attribute to describe the embedded content, and a height attribute and a width attribute to set the element to a proper size.
